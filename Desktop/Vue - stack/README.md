# Full Stack Project

## Introduction

In this project my brief is to create a better way of sharing codesnippets and knowledge between teams with easy access to recall a previous snippet.
The user must have the ability to create, edit and delete a snippet.

### Snippet Model

The snippet needs to have the following fields:

- Team Members name or it has been created by (selected from a static drop down list)
- Title
- Snippet Description
- Lastly the actual snippet itself!

### Tech Stack I will be using

- Django RESTful API
- Postgres Database
- Vue.js
- Tailwind CSS
